# TitanicAnalysis-Prediction
Welcome to my repository for the Titanic Analysis and Prediction!

This is a self-learning project from analyzing data, training ML models, as well as deploying it onto Heroku.

Take a look at the Titanic ML.ipynb to browse through my analysis on the features and how they are correlated to the survival of the passengers.

The predictor site is at https://titanic-p.herokuapp.com/. The UI is simple and straightforward that asks for the user to input the features that will be used for prediction.

The limitation of this project will be due to the imbalanced dataset affecting the prediction output. Hopefully, in my next projects, these issues will be addressed to ensure that the model trained is fair and accurate.
